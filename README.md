# MyCosplanner

This project is a test to practice with Angular. It's using Angular 8.2.1.

I tried to reproduce the app [Cosplanner](http://www.cosplanner.net/) that is a cosplay project manager. It has many awesome features like shopping list, to do list, saving reference pictures. And for each project you'll have some statistics like budget management, progress in percent, and many others.

I choosed this app, first because I'm using it and it's really helpfull. Plus, it have many features to reproduce and I have a lot of new one to add. So I know that with this project, I will practice a lot with Angular.

# Design

I designed all the mockup for the project in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I tried to use colors that match for a planning app.
You will find all the design mockup here : https://github.com/Shixika/myCosplanner/tree/master/maquette

# Library

I use [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) for components and [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/) for dates manipulation.
