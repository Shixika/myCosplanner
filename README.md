# MyCosplanner

This project allows me to practice with Angular. It's currently in progress.

I try to reproduce the app <a href="http://www.cosplanner.net/" alt="Cosplanner website - new tab" target="_blank">Cosplanner</a> that is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay" alt="Cosplay definition - new tab" target="_blank">_cosplay_</a> project manager. It has many awesome features like shopping list, to do list, saving reference pictures. And for each project you'll have some statistics like budget management, progress in percent, and many others.

I choosed this app, first, because I'm using it and it's really helpfull. Plus, it have many features to reproduce and I have a lot of new one to add (like maybe more stats and new socials features). So I know that with this project, I will practice a lot with Angular.

# Design

I designed all the mockup for the project in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I tried to use colors that match for a planning app.
You will find all the design mockup here : https://github.com/Shixika/myCosplanner/tree/master/maquette

# Library

I use [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) for components and [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/) for dates manipulation.
